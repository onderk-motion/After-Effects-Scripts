Hi, I'm Onder and I'm a Freelance Sr. Motion Designer and Content creator.
I create scripts for my projects and you can use or customize them for your needs.

## Set Viewer Resolution
Quickly set the viewer resolution (Full, Half, Third, Quarter) for the active comp, selected comps, or all compositions in your project.

## Toggle Motion Blur for Selected Layers
Quickly toggle the motion blur switch for every selected layer in the active composition.
If at least one selected layer has motion blur disabled, all selected layers are enabled.
If motion blur is already enabled everywhere, the script disables it for the selected layers.

## Apply Parent Prefix to Selected Layers
Prefix each selected layer's name with its parent layer's name in the active composition.
The script replaces underscores in the parent name with spaces, skips layers without parents, and avoids applying duplicate prefixes.

## Ungroup Selected Shape Groups
Ungroup each selected shape group while leaving nested sub-groups untouched.
Run the script to apply the built-in Ungroup Shapes command to every selected shape group in the Timeline.

## Split Project Saver
Split your project into multiple copies with a configurable number of comps per file.
The palette UI highlights duplicate or risky names, supports Regular or Random grouping, optional comp labeling, and saves a trimmed project for each set.

## Shape Separator
Separate shape layer groups into individual layers. The script also ungroups a single main group before the separation step.
Usage: File > Scripts > Run Script File... or add to KBar.

## Bounding Box
Create customizable bounding boxes around selected layers with precise world transform calculations.
Features:
- Custom colors and stroke styles
- Smart layer parenting
Options:
- `showDialog: true` shows the customization dialog (default)
- `showDialog: false` runs immediately with preset values and no dialog

## Create Controller & Add Dropdown Menu Control
Customize dropdown menu controllers and add them to your scripts even if you are just getting started.

## Paste Text from Clipboard
Paste text from the clipboard to the selected text layer in After Effects without opening the layer.
You can also assign a shortcut to run the script with one click.

## Convert Digit Names
Convert composition and layer names between numeric and text representations.

## Prompt Unused Compositions
Display the names of compositions that are not used in your project.

## Quick Rename Selected Layer or Active Comp
Quickly change the name of the selected layer in the viewer or Timeline.
If no layer is selected, the script prompts to rename the composition.
Place it in the Script folder and assign a keyboard shortcut or mouse button.

## Rename Layers by Alphabet
Rename layers sequentially using alphabet characters, placing each character on its own layer.

## Select Paths
Select every path within the chosen layer.
Place it in MoBar or KBar and use it with one button or run it as a script.

## Duplicate Layers Below
Duplicate a layer and move the copy underneath instead of above the original layer.
Assign a keyboard shortcut for quick access.

## Multi Replace with Project Items
Replace timeline items with project items in bulk using either a regular or random option.
