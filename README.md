Hi, I'm Onder and I'm a Freelance Sr. Motion Designer and Content creator.
I creating some script for my projects and you can use or customize for your need.

# **Set Viewer Resolution**
Quickly sets the viewer resolution (Full, Half, Third, Quarter) for the active comp, selected comps, or all compositions in your project.

# **Shape Separator**
Separates shape layer groups into individual layers. This is different from other scripts, it handles single-group cases by ungrouping first

## Special Feature: ## 
Automatically ungroups single main groups before separation

Usage: File > Scripts > Run Script File... or add to KBar

# **Bounding Box**
Creates customizable bounding boxes around selected layers with precise world transform calculations.

## Bounding Box Features: 
- Custom colors & stroke styles 
- Smart layer parenting

## Bounding Box Options:
- `showDialog: true` - Shows the customization dialog (default)
- `showDialog: false` - Runs immediately with preset values, no dialog


# **Create Controller & Add Dropdown Menu Control**
Dropdown menu controllers can be issue if you beginner. You can customize and add your script.

# **Paste Text from Clipboard**
Sometimes, copied text doesn't paste to text in #aftereffects. 
This script paste the text from the clipboard to the selected text layer in After Effects. 
It also allows you to paste text without double-clicking and opening it. If you assign a shortcut, you can use it with one click. 

# **Convert Digit Names**
If your Composition name and the names of the layers in it are just numbers, it converts them to text. Or vice versa.

# **Prompt Unused Compositions**
It displays the names of the compositions not used in your project.

# **Quick Rename Selected Layer or Active Comp**
You can quickly change the name of the selected layer in the viewer or timeline. 
If a layer is not selected, the name of the composition will prompt for change.
Place it in the Script folder, and assign a keyboard shortcut or mouse button.

# **Rename Layers by Alphabet**
This script renames the layers by alphabet. Each character is placed on a separate layer

# **Select Paths**
You can easily select all paths in the selected layer.
Place in MoBar or KBar and use with one button or run as a script. 

# **Duplicate Layers Below**
When you duplicate layers with Ctrl+D, new layers are placed above the original layer.
But with this script, you can easily duplicate the layer and move it underneath. You can also use it with a keyboard shortcut.

# **Multi Replace with Project Items**
No need to manually replace each project item with timeline items. 
You can replace items using a button with a regular or random option.
