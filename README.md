Hi, I'm Onder and I'm a Freelance Sr. Motion Designer and Content creator.
I creating some script for my projects and you can use or customize for your need.

# **Paste Text from Clipboard**
Sometimes, copied text doesn't paste to text. This script paste the text from the clipboard to the selected text layer in After Effects. It also allows you to paste text without double-clicking and opening it. If you assign a shortcut, you can use it with one click. 

# **Convert Digit Names**
If your Composition name and the names of the layers in it are just numbers, it converts them to text. Or vice versa.

# **Prompt Unused Compositions**
It displays the names of the compositions not used in your project.

# **Quick Rename Selected Layer or Active Comp**
You can quickly change the name of the selected layer in the viewer or timeline. 
If a layer is not selected, the name of the composition will prompt for change.
Place it in the Script folder, and assign a keyboard shortcut or mouse button.

# **Rename Layers by Alphabet**
This script renames the layers by alphabet. Each character is placed on a separate layer

# **Select Paths**
You can easily select all paths in the selected layer.
Place in MoBar or KBar and use with one button or run as a script. 

# **Duplicate Layers Below**
When you duplicate layers with Ctrl+D, new layers are placed above the original layer.
But with this script, you can easily duplicate the layer and move it underneath. You can also use it with a keyboard shortcut.

# **Multi Replace with Project Items**
No need to manually replace each project item with timeline items. 
You can replace items using a button with a regular or random option.
