Hi, I'm Onder and I'm a Freelance Sr. Motion Designer and Content creator.
I creating some script for my projects and you can use or customize for your need.

#### **Convert Digit Names**
If your Composition name and the names of the layers in it are just numbers, it converts them to text. Or vice versa.

#### **Prompt Unused Compositions**
It displays the names of the compositions not used in your project.

#### **Quick Rename Selected Layer or Active Comp**
You can quickly change the name of the selected layer in the viewer or timeline. 
If a layer is not selected, the name of the composition will prompt for change.
Place it in the Script folder, and assign a keyboard shortcut or mouse button.

#### **Rename Layers by Alphabet**
This script renames the layers by alphabet. Each character is placed on a separate layer

#### **Select Paths**
You can easily select all paths in the selected layer.
Place in MoBar or KBar and use with one button or run as a script.
